{"top_img": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/aids.jpg", "text": "Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and \u201clikely increased\u201d the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe congressional report, titled,\u201cThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,\u201d was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clinton\u2019s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation\u2019s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA\u2019s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, \u201calleged due to the company\u2019s diluted drugs, it \u2018subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,\u2019\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company\u2019s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it\u2019s disturbing and very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by
